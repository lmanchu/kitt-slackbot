### Completed Stories

#### Story LMA-30-1: Create skills directory structure and registry foundation ✅
- **Commit**: a41c391e3d3dea2d3b81f375e9a7bf92ca107904
- **Date**: 2026-02-20 08:34:39
- **Changes**:
  - Created `src/skills/` directory structure
  - Implemented `src/skills/registry.js` with `loadSkills()` function
  - Created comprehensive test suite at `test/skills/registry.test.js`
  - Updated main `test.js` to include skills registry tests
  - All tests pass (4/4)
  - Follows Node.js module conventions with proper exports
- **Tests**: 
  - Directory structure validation
  - Registry import functionality
  - Module conventions compliance
  - Empty skills directory handling

### Codebase Patterns

#### Skills Architecture
- Skills are organized as subdirectories under `src/skills/`
- Each skill should have an `index.js` file with a `register(app)` function
- The registry scans directories and calls `skill.register(app)` for each valid skill
- Error handling: Failed skill loads don't crash the system, just log warnings
- Console logging pattern: `[Skills] <action>: <skillname>` for consistency

#### Testing Structure
- Tests organized in `test/` directory mirroring `src/` structure
- Registry tests include: import validation, directory structure, module conventions
- Console output mocking pattern for testing logging behavior
- Test runner returns boolean success for integration

### Next Stories Remaining: 16
